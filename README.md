# Hybrid-Path-Planner
Exploring an unknown place autonomously is a challenge for robots, especially when the environment is changing. Moreover, in real world application, efficient path planning is crucial  for autonomous vehicles to have timely response to execute a collision-free motion. In this paper we focus on environment exploration which enables an automated system to establish a map of an unknown environment with dynamic objects moving within it. We introduce an exploration package that enables robotâ€™s self-exploration with an online collision avoidance planner. The package consists of exploration module, global planner module and local planner module. We modularize the package so that developers can easily make modifications or even substitutions to some modules for their specific application.
